			<h3>Introduction:</h3>
		<p>The intent of this site is to elevate an often-overlooked topic back into the public arena. We aim to accomplish this by using a combination of general source material and a theoretical example. This will be followed by an anonymous form that asks users to rank preferred sources in the use case scenario.</p>
		<p>The overall goal is to discuss our current energy alternatives' respective pro's, con's and their impact on the environment. If we accomplish anything beyond mere amusement, the hopes are to promote healthy discourse. The intended audience is all energy consumers.</p> 
		<p> In this theoretical example, we will be specifically referring to our (United States) commercial electricity supply sources. The reference sites below are used for ranking current energy usage and giving a brief description of the technologies. It is intended that the user read about the technologies on their respective pages if they have questions. The current sources ranked by usage are:</p> 
			<ol>
				<li>Natural Gas (referred to as NatGas herein)</li>	
				<li>Coal</li>
				<li>Nuclear</li>	
				<li>Wind</li>	
				<li>Solar</li>
			</ol> 
		<h3>Theoretical Scenario:</h3>
		<p>For this example, each participant is asked to review the home bubble they would live in for one year. This home bubble will include a home for you and your family. (Click on the picture for a description.)</p>
		<ol>
			<li>There is enough food, water, animals, trees, grass and vegetation to sustain human life.</li>
			<li>Beneath the ground of your bubble is the water aquifer that feeds the surface pool. Be careful not to contaminate your water supply. This is your only water supply.</li>
			<li>The minerals and ores required to both make and / or sustain the power plant of your choosing are in the ground. All power plants need to be made from something (metals / ores). They do not just exist. Remember, digging under your home bubble can cause instability and cave-ins. It can also lead to contaminating your aquifer.</li>
			<li>Your air supply is limited. That is, if you use all the oxygen and do not leave enough green vegetation to replenish it, you will suffocate.</li>
			<li>Airborne pollutants will collect only in your bubble for this experiment.</li>
			<li>You are not allowed to pollute into your neighbor's bubble. This means in any form (air, heat or water.) In this scenario, your neighbors are all environmental lawyers just waiting to sue you if you do so.</li>
			<li>The side video from YouTube reminds you about things that can happen when your waste products are not disposed of or handled properly. Some of these power plants will have waste streams to consider.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You should review each power source individually. All the listed sources can supply electricity to large portions or even whole cities if running under "ideal" conditions.</p>
