										<p>Many years to go

									</header>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly I have made most of the mistakes one can make in a trade learning the hard way, some more than once. As Jocko Willink says though, you have to own it. I surely have not made my last. There is; however, a difference between ignorance and stupidity. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Call me naive, but it took me many years to learn the difference. There was a time when I carried a chip on my shoulder; but now, I just don't deal with it. Know the things you can change, and know when someone is wasting your time. Not to be a hypocrite, mistakes are mistakes and my scorecard has a lot. But those that would intentionally mislead or subvert another person's progress don't deserve your time. Not giving a person the tools, time and training to complete a job correctly is a recipe for disaster. Garbage in equals garbage out. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned enough and accumulated enough experience and licenses to know the difference between good intentions with mistakes and something very different from that. 10 plus years of commercial HVAC service work in buildings that ranged from strip malls up to colleges, federal buildings, city facilities, hospitals and factories has taught me the tell tail signs. With literally hundreds of service calls under my belt, I understand flexibility. But, I know what correct and not correct looks like. Life is short.</p>

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>What am I doing with my time? Just sitting around? No. Learning and trying new things to me. I know kids in school might be ahead of my progress in this area, but I come with other skills they don't yet possess. Four more classes to go for my Software Design degree. Last semester was 15 credits so I can try and get done. What I hope this shows is that I am trainable.</p>

												<h4>Taking a stab at my own Control System</h4>
												<p>While I wait in the wings, I will try and go on to build some of the core functions of a junior level controller. Thermostat is too easy. Did that.....zzzzzzzzz. This project has not made me a master in any of these technologies, but I find the challenge both aggravating and rewarding. It's like golf. LOL.
