<!-- (from the text) - Visit a website that interests you. Print the home page or one other pertinent page from the site. Write a one-page summary and reaction to the website you chose to visit. Address the following topics. ○ For this course you'll modify this, so that rather than writing a page, you'll create a webpage. ○ Put these questions and answers into a new validating webpage, and provide a link to the page from this forum. Use nicely formed bullets l​ists, paragraphs, or a combination of the two. Note that you should include html 5 AND css validation, and from now on, link all your pages to a css file that styles your pages. -->

		<dt><b>What is the company/organization?</b></dt>
			<dd>I chose the number one on-line retailer, Amazon.</dd>
		<dt><b>What is the URL?</b></dt>
			<dd><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">https://www.amazon.com</a></dd>
		<dt><b>What is the purpose of the site?</b></dt>
			<dd>The purpose of the site is primarily to sell goods and merchandise to consumers. However, they also provide other services like streaming content and advanced e-commerce web sites, hosting and support.</dd>
		<dt><b>Who is the intended audience?</b></dt>
			<dd> Any consumer with a form of electronic payment is in the target demographic. The company sells almost any commercialy or retail store-based product. As an entrepreneur, they provide both support and web hosting to all sizes of companies from a small mom-and-pop up to large scale commercial entities.</dd>
		<dt><b>Do you believe the site reaches its audience?</b></dt>
			<dd> Without a doubt. They have by far surpassed previous retailers like E-Bay and are now number one in on-line retail. Their net worth is quickly surpassing most brick and mortar stores. They are clearly giving traditionally dominant retailers a run for their money. It was reported in a recent article that Amazon surpassed Walmart. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-retailers-2019-amazon-walmart-alibaba/#53814b534171">Forbes Article</a></dd>
		<dt><b>Who is the intended audience?</b></dt>
			<dd>The entire consumer population on the planet Earth. The company has hubs and distribution centers on several strategic continents.</dd>
		<dt><b>Was the site useful to you? Why or why not?</b></dt>
			<dd> Yes. It would be the golden rule to use for designing an e-commerce site.
			</dd>
		<dt><b>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website, etc.</b></dt>
			<dd> Most of the background is made up of a monochrome layout. The absolute lowest footer is black, while both the header and 2nd stage of the footer are slightly lighter. Then the background behind the actual items for sale is yet another shade of gray lighter. This leaves the products, whose background is bright white, to stand out. It is visually appealing and easy on the eyes. Additionaly, most products are rendered smaller with the option to zoom in and inspect in fine detail.
			</dd>
		<dt><b>How does the use of color and graphics enhance the website?</b></dt>
			<dd>They make it easier for a person to understand what the product is. If the site was FTP with only word descriptions, they would be a total failure. Almost no person in the modern world will buy things sight unseen.</dd>
