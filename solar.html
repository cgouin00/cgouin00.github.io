      <h3>Solar:</h3>
      <p><em>Brief discussion:</em> Solar electrical power in a commercial application has most often meant using large banks or arrays of photovoltaic solar panels to capture sun-light. The electricity produced by these panels would be subsequently fed into a power grid. This electrical grid supplies consumers electrical demands. <em>Note:</em> There are other solar methods (thermal) that exist for making electricity, but they are not currently used on a large scale commercially or available for end users.</p>
        
      <p>Smaller consumer grade systems are available for homeowners to purchase directly. This method is completely scalable to the user's needs. This can also include onsite energy storage. Some manufacturers offer extended warranties or even guarantees for the lifetime of the home. </p>
	
      <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Solar panels have proven to be mechanically and electrically reliable. Current lifespans can range from 5-20 years depending on manufacturer and grade.</p>
        <p><strong>Location of fuel:</strong> The fuel source for this method is the sun itself. There are no actions necessary to acquire the fuel. Rare ores and silicas required to make the panels are mined from the earth. This is considered a renewable fuel.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of acquiring fuel:</strong> Light is "delivered" to the power plant naturally. No additional labor is required.</p>
        <p><strong>Byproducts of power creation:</strong> There are currently no byproducts to consider when using this method.</p>
        <p><strong>Factors affecting stability:</strong> 
            <ol>
              <li>Time of day</li>
              <li>Cloud cover</li>
              <li>Time of year</li>
              <li>Longitude</li>
              <li>Hail damage</li>
              <li>Dust and debris build up</li>
              <li>Vegetation blocking sun</li> 
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rate of fuel consumption:</strong> This type of system (without energy storage option) generally either meets the demand or does not. There are not methods available to quickly raise power output if the sun is as bright as it can get. The only way to raise power output is to add more panels to compensate for any factors degrading the performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical ranking:</strong> It is currently last in overall total power produced, although it was at one point slightly ahead of wind technology in the U.S.</p>
        <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> Solar installations are steadily increasing. The likelihood of their existence in 20-30 years is extremely high.</p>
