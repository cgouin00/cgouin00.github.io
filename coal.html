      <h3>Coal:</h3>
      <p><em>Brief discussion:</em> Coal power is by far the oldest electricity generating method currently in use in the U.S. Most of that is due to the fact it's inate simplicity. In basic terms: First you must dig up some earth. You might have to dig up some other thigs to burn with it like lime. Then you transport them to the place where they will be burned. Some methods burn it as is, some de-gassify, some even pulverize it to fine powder first. You collect and remove the ashes and byproducts. This process is generally continuous. There are a myriad of physical methods and configurations that have evolved over time.</p>
        
      <p>In the history of coal in the U.S., it has been used in residential applications for heating and even some have used it for cooking. It was used for a long time as a source of fuel for trains. However, this method does not practicaly scale down to consumer grade / sized power plants. </p>
	
      <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> As with natural gas, coal plants can have very long lifetimes. They do however require a large amount of maintenance. They require large numbers of personnel to monitor and operate. There are periodic shut down and inspections. In addition there can be instances where a unit is taken off line to clean soot or clinkers depending on the grade of coal being burnt. They also frequently need tubes replaced in their boiler sections due to the corrosive nature of the combustion byproducts.</p>
        <p><strong>Location of fuel:</strong> The fuel source for this method is predominantly underground. There are also large patches of coal above ground (surface mining.) The geology and history of a particular area are large factors in the abundance and quality of coal deposits.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of acquiring fuel:</strong> Coal must be mined; either underground or on the surface. Historically this had required large groups of people to physically mine coal. However, automation and large industrialized machinery have reduced a significant portion of that labor. It must then be transported (mostly by train) to the point of use.</p>
				<p><strong>Byproducts of power creation:</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Combustion products into the atmosphere</li>
						<li>Waste heat</li>
						<li>Large volumes of coal ash must be stored or removed</li>
						<li>Noise</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
        <p><strong>Factors affecting stability:</strong> 
            <ol>
              <li>Type of coal</li>
              <li>Physical state of plant</li>
              <li>Cleanliness of internals</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rate of fuel consumption:</strong> Coal fuel consumption is by far the most demanding (of the non-renewable methods) to maintain due to the sheer volume of physical material that must be continuosly moved and stored for operation. Very often coal plants will have large piles built up in reserve on-site to keep up with demand and provide a time buffer in case of shortages or increased demands. They sometimes store it internally (powdered form) in hoppers or day-tanks  to feed the plants a day ahead of schedule. This is a non-renewable fuel source.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical ranking:</strong> Coal is currently second behind natural gas. It has enjoyed a very long run as the industry leader but increased attention to emissions and byproducts have made it less favorable.</p>
        <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> Coal use actually seems to fluctuate with regulation. The trend may be upward if regulation is relaxed. The likelihood of their existence in 20-30 years is likely.</p>
