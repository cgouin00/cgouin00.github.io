      <h3>Nuclear:</h3>
      <p><em>Brief discussion:</em> Nuclear power has been around for several decades. Like the other non-renewable methods, it involves acquiring a fuel (most often uranium) from underground. That fuel is heavily refined into a highly purified form. It is by far the most expensive to make and operate of all known power producing methods. Due to its potentially catastrophic side effects (if used incorrectly), nuclear plants price tags are multiples higher than that of a similar sized coal or natural gas plant. Layers of redundancy and additional safety controls are needed to ensure public safety. </p>
        
      <p>Although the U.S. government once considered using this technology in all kinds of transportation (from planes to cars), it was never enacted upon. It has been scaled down to very small sizes used in experimental submarines, military and satellites. However, it has not been allowed to be used by the general public.</p> 
				
			<p>This technology has held a long period of near zero growth. Incidents like the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 made regulators and power producers reconsider it's growth. There was a longstanding moratorium on creating any new plants that was only recently relaxed.

      <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Nuclear power has been reliable for several decades. Plants can continue to operate for long periods of time with intermittent refueling. The number of operating hours without failure far exceeds the times where human error caused accidents. As with coal and natural gas, these plants require a large crew of trained personnel to operate.</p>
        <p><strong>Location of fuel:</strong> The fuel source for this method is usually found underground. It requires heavy refining or "enrichment" to become usable. This is a very expensive and highly technical process that takes significant time. The entire process is very labor intensive from acquisition to finished product. This is a non-renewable fuel source.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of acquiring fuel:</strong> Re-fueling a nuclear plant can be a long down time evolution. The spent fuel itself must be physically and carefully removed and then stored. New fuel is inserted and the plant is returned to operation. These operations can take weeks to months to complete.  </p>
				<p><strong>Byproducts of power creation:</strong></p>
				<ol>
						<li>Waste heat</li>
						<li>Noise</li>
						<li>Radiation</li>
						<li>Radioactive Waste</li>
						<li>Spent fuel</li>
				</ol
        <p><strong>Factors affecting stability:</strong></p> 
            <ol>
							<li>Operational skill set</li>
							<li>Plant maintenance</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rate of fuel consumption:</strong> Fuel usage in this application can most likened to using a battery. It is commonly rated for a certain number of full power hours at a given capacity. That life is directly related to what level the plant is loaded. When the fuel is consumed, it must be replaced.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical ranking:</strong> It is currently last in the non-renewable category and third overall.</p>
        <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> Nuclear plants have only just recently been reauthorized for new installations. The trend is neutral at best. The likelihood of their existence in 20-30 years depends upon policy decisions.</p>
