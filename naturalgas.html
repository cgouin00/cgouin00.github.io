      <h3>Natural Gas:</h3>
      <p><em>Brief discussion:</em> Natural gas has had many uses as a fuel. Traditionally in the U.S. it has been used as a fuel for making heat for commercial processes, cooking or temperature control in cold climates. However, its use as a fuel for gas powered turbines (to make electricity) has accelerated in the last few decades. This has been primarily due to the fact that it burns significantly cleaner than the previous top producer (coal.) Additionally, it is cheaper for utilities to acquire this fuel than coal.</p>
        
      <p>This method of producing power does not scale down to smaller consumer grade systems. Similar methods to this same basic type of technology can be found in locomotion or jet engines.</p>
	
      <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Natural gas turbine power plants are highly specialized. They require teams of skilled technicians and engineers to operate (even with automation systems in place.) Turbines and the associated power plants can last for many years with proper maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong>Location of fuel:</strong> The fuel source for this method is primarily located underground.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of acquiring fuel:</strong> The most prevalent method of getting this fuel is known as hydraulic fracturing or sometimes referred to as "fracking." This typically involves drilling deep into the ground and injecting a combination of proprietary chemicals under high pressure to cause the gas to come out via a chemical reaction. That gas is collected and shipped to point of use. It can be liquified to increase the volume prior to delivery. It can be pumped in this form via underground systems. This is a labor intensive process.</p>
        <p><strong>Byproducts of power creation:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Waste heat</li>
            <li>Combustion products into the atmosphere</li>
            <li>Noise</li>
            <li>Potential chemical hazards associated with fracking fluids (currently under review.)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Factors affecting stability:</strong> 
            <ol>
              <li>Availability of fuel</li>
              <li>Plant operation</li>
              <li>Maintenance routine</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rate of fuel consumption:</strong> This type of system requires a rate of fuel delivery to match power consumption. It has the ability to scale up or down very quickly in capacity to match demand. This requires the fuel to be piped directly to the plant. This may be in tanks or pipes coming from other vessels. Periodic refueling is a necessity. This is a non-renewable resource.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical ranking:</strong> It is currently the top overall total power producer. This has come as an indirect result of recent intense environmental scrutiny of power plant emissions. It's relatively reduced emissions (compared to coal) has taken it from being what was a back-up power supply for peak power usage periods to the number one choice of utilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> Natural gas installations are increasing. The likelihood of their existence in 20-30 years is high.</p>
