      <h3>Wind:</h3>
      <p><em>Brief discussion:</em> Wind mills have been around for centuries. This was predominantly used for grinding foods or pumping water. Wind power as a commercial application for electricity is most often achieved by lining up rows of mills / generators in areas where the weather patterns are known to be consistent. This has proven successful near the ocean or other large bodies of water where tides and air patterns produce sustained winds. They have been used in flat open planes areas. Some have been installed on or near mountains to take advantage of wind patterns.</p>
        
      <p>Smaller consumer grade systems are available for homeowners to purchase directly. These  are scalable to the user's needs.</p>
	
      <h3>Things to consider:</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Wind mills have proven to be mechanically and electrically sound if weather patterns permit. However, too much wind does not work. Units can be damaged by extreme high winds.</p>
        <p><strong>Location of fuel:</strong> The fuel source for this method is wind gusts themselves. There are no actions necessary to acquire the fuel. Metals are required to make mills initially. This is considered a renewable fuel.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of acquiring fuel:</strong> Wind is "delivered" to the power plant naturally. No additional labor is required.</p>
        <p><strong>Byproducts of power creation:</strong> There are currently no byproducts to consider when using this method.</p>
        <p><strong>Factors affecting stability:</strong> 
            <ol>
              <li>Weather patterns</li>
              <li>Tides</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rate of fuel consumption:</strong> This type of system generally either meets the demand or does not. The only way to increase performance is to add more towers.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical ranking:</strong> It was at one point last. However, it is currently ranked fourth due to the fact that it has been proven more stable than solar if applied in the correct location.</p>
        <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> Wind installations are steadily increasing. The trend is upward. The likelihood of their existence in 20-30 years is high.</p>
