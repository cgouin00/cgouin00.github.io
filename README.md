This is sort of a pseudo-highlights quasi resume.
Althoug it is not in any way complete, it's more tailored
towards the areas that I hope to go further in.
( Being building automation and controls. )

Admittedly, I used a template from a website. After many
video reviews of "experts" on line I got the impression
that no one wants to see a newb's attempt at HTML / CSS / JS / JQuery.
And rightfully so, I am no where near an expert.
There is so much to learn.
